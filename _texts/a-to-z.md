- If I had a letter for every year
- {:.indent-1}I could spell 'azure':
- A colour of a coast
- {:.indent-1}that draws desires upon its warm waters
- And calls forth ships and souls,
- {:.indent-1}and lighthouses and moons, new and full
- A colour, all but perfectly clear
- {:.indent-1}at the furthest reaches of its embrace
- And indistinguishable
- {:.indent-1}from the sky at the line beyond the eyes
- A colour transcending name and form,
- {:.indent-1}beyond letters and words, cadences and tides
- I could spell it, a radiant desert
- {:.indent-1}at home against a land it made beautiful
- devoured in the instant,
- {:.indent-1}belonging to millennia
- I could spell it, and that would be all I could do
- {:.indent-1}and that would be enough
