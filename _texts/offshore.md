- Endless is—2.9 miles
- the distance from the eye to the horizon
- and all the world one will ever see

- Endless is—a year, or three, or seven
- the duration between decisions
- and a lifetime of mistakes yet made

- Endless, too, is yesterday, or tomorrow
- the time of memories, the time of possibilities
- and the moments that are not today

- And endless, endless is offshore
- the place beyond the oceans
- where storms rage and suns shine
- where the world lies, and where stories are untold
